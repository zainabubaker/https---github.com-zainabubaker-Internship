Machine Learning ( Artificial Neural Network ) Dr. Emad Natsheh Types of Machine Learning PERCEPTRON Biological Neuron vs Perceptron What is Perceptron ‚Ä¢ It 's a single node neural network that can take different inputs but produce only one output ‚Ä¢ Perceptron is usually used to classify the data into two parts . Therefore , it is also known as a Linear Binary Classifier . How does the neuron determine its output ? 1 . Computes the weighted sum input 2 . Apply the value to the activation function ( step , sign , sigmoid , linear ) How does the neuron determine its output ? Activation Functions Example How does a perceptron learn ‚ùñThis is done by making small adjustments in the weights to reduce the difference between the actual and desired outputs of the perceptron Perceptron learn Perceptron learn Perceptron learn Perceptron Example ‚Äì AND Perceptron Example ‚Äì AND ‚Ä¢ Epoch 1 ‚Äì Iteration 1 ( input X1=0 ; X2=0 ; Yd=0 ) : ‚Ä¢ ( 0 * 0.3 + 0 * -0.1 ) -0.2 = -0.2 ‚Ä¢ Ya =step ( -0.2 ) =0 ‚Ä¢ Error=Yd-Ya= 0 ‚Ä¢ ‚àÜw1=0 ; ‚àÜw2=0 ; ‚Äì Iteration 2 ( input X1=0 ; X2=1 ; Yd=0 ) : ‚Ä¢ ( 0 * 0.3 + 1 * -0.1 ) -0.2 = -0.3 ‚Ä¢ Ya =step ( -0.3 ) =0 ‚Ä¢ Error=Yd-Ya= 0 ‚Ä¢ ‚àÜw1=0 ; ‚àÜw2=0 ; Perceptron Example ‚Äì AND ‚Äì Iteration 3 ( input X1=1 ; X2=0 ; Yd=0 ) ‚Ä¢ ( 1 * 0.3 + 0 * -0.1 ) -0.2 = +0.1 ‚Ä¢ Ya =step ( +0.1 ) =1 ‚Ä¢ Error=Yd-Ya= -1 ‚Ä¢ ‚àÜw1= 0.1 * 1 * -1= -0.1 ‚Ä¢ W1 ( new ) =w1 ( old ) + ‚àÜw1 =0.3-0.1 =0.2 ‚Ä¢ ‚àÜw2 =0 Perceptron Example ‚Äì AND Perceptron Example ‚Äì AND Summary ‚Ä¢ Single perceptron can be trained to recognize any linear separable function ‚Ä¢ Perceptron is able to represent a function only if there is some line that separates all the black dots from all the white dots Decision line w1 x1 + w2 x2 = q Drawing Line Y= 2x-2 ùüè Y= - ùüê x+1 Drawing Line ( AND example ) 0.1X1 + 0.1X2-0.2=0 X2=-X1 + 2 Summary Summary Summary ‚Ä¢ A Neural Network Playground - TensorFlow Next Topic ‚Ä¢ Feed-forward neural network
