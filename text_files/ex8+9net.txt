Objectives : To be familiar with wireless network installation . Set up the adhoc mode and infrastructure for the wireless network . Give the wireless network security . Learn about the Access point 's operation and its underlying principles . Construct a network and use the network we have created to send files and data . Introduction : There are two sorts of networks : the broadly address network ( WAN or WLAN ) , which mostly depends on wireless technology , and the local area network ( LAN ) , which primarily depends on Ethernet technology . Tools : Cisco access point . 2x PCs . 1 straight forward Ethernet cable . Console cable . Procedure : Part 1 : WLAN infrastructure : Getting and Assigning an IP Address First , we use the console cable to connect the first station to the access point so that we can begin configuring the AP . Once we enter the terminal to begin the configuration process , the access point asks for a password , which is CISCO . Please refer to the following image for clarification . Next , we were instructed to use the ( sh run ) command , which will display details about the settings of the access point , including the model number , the encryption used , the IP and MAC addresses , and so forth . Following that , we assign IP addresses to both stations ( PCs ) . It is important to ensure that we assign IP addresses to the wireless network card rather than the Ethernet , as shown in the following image : Next , we were requested to provide the access point an IP address . To do this , we first went into the AP 's setup mode and selected the interface that was connected to the first station , as seen in the following image : Configuring Basic Settings : After entering the browser 's address and the access point 's name in this section , the following page appears : Cisco was the username and password.After that , we logged in . Following our sign-in , the following page—dubbed the `` Summary Status page '' —was displayed . The summary status ( Association , Network Identity , Network Interface , and Event Log ) is available on this page . On the left side of it is a tiny menu as well . Next , we clicked on the Express Setup button to access the Express Setup page , where we modified the host name to AP-8 as shown in the following image : Setting up Security Configuration : The following screen shows up once we 've navigated to the Express Security page : We configured the setting as shown in the picture : This screen appears after applying the express security settings : Radio Interface Enabling : We selected 802.11G from the Summary Status page . The radio 802.11G home page appears . Then , we turned on 802.11G from the settings : Then clicked apply . Then we did the same steps for 802.11A . Network interfaces in the home page after enabling the radio 802.11G and 802.11A . Setting Up Wireless Settings : We saw that the wireless network connection list included the AP.8.It requested the Security key ( 123456 ) when we joined . Then we pinged between the PCs . Finally , we selected System Configuration from System Software and saved it by clicking on config.txt . If we ever needed to use it again , we saved it . Part 3 : Configuring an Ad Hoc Mode WLAN with Windows 7 . We did the configuration by following these steps : We set up the Ad Hoc network by give it the name ( Adhoc_lab_8 ) , security type ( WEP ) , security key ( Net123456 ) . Then we save the network . Then , we noticed that the ( Adhoc_lab_8 ) was shown in the wireless network connection list , and we connected to it from the two PC ’ s . We made a folder on the PC1 , then shared it with PC2 as we learned in the lab before , when we opened the folder on PC2 , we wrote on it , and we saw the folder after update it on PC1 , and everything was right . Conclusion : In this experiment we learned how to install and set up a wide area network ( WAN ) , and how to configure the access point and create a WLAN that any station can connect to it , also we know how to build the WLAN in both modes the infrastructure and the adhoc mode , in addition to the difference between these 2 modes and there pros and cons , we also get to know how to transmit the files using a wireless connection . Objectives : To get familiar with the routing algorithms such as DSDV protocol . To get familiar with the wireless networks and its types . To get familiar with the adhoc wireless network . Introduction : The experiment focuses on exploring routing protocols within wireless ad hoc networks , particularly emphasizing the performance evaluation of the Destination- Sequenced Distance-Vector ( DSDV ) protocol . It distinguishes between infrastructured networks , which rely on access points for communication and face challenges with mobility , and ad hoc networks , which facilitate direct peer-to-peer communication among devices without centralized infrastructure . Within ad hoc networks , routing protocols are categorized as proactive ( table-driven ) or reactive ( on-demand ) , with examples including DSDV , Dynamic Source Routing ( DSR ) , Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing ( AODV ) , and Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm ( TORA ) . The experiment aims to provide practical insights into these protocols ' functionality and performance . Using simulation tools like Ns2 and Nam on Ubuntu 14.04 , students create network topologies , script simulation scenarios , and analyze trace files to extract performance metrics . These metrics include packet transmission , routing efficiency , and network behavior under varying conditions . Through experimentation and analysis , students gain a deeper understanding of wireless network dynamics , routing protocols , and performance evaluation methodologies . The experiment also highlights challenges inherent in wireless routing , particularly in dynamic environments characterized by mobility . It encourages students to consider alternative metrics , such as Average End-to-End packet delivery time , and leverage visualization tools like Nam for deeper insights into network behavior . Overall , the experiment offers a comprehensive exploration of routing protocols in wireless ad hoc networks , providing valuable insights into their operation and performance evaluation . Tools : Ubuntu 14.04 ( O.S . ) Ns2 ( application ) Nam ( application ) Xgraph ( application ) Procedure : Part1 : Simple Network Topology In the initial phase of our experiment , we were tasked with simulating a basic network setup featuring a Drop Tail queue . This involved initiating the process by compiling the primary file , known as ns-simple.tcl . Once compiled , this file yields an output in the form of a NAM file . NAM files are typically employed for modeling groundwater flows , but in our context , they serve as essential data repositories for our network simulation . Additionally , as part of the setup process , we launch Xgraph , a visualization tool . Xgraph provides graphical representation of the simulation , displaying various metrics and behaviors of the nodes within the network . Before commencing the actual simulation , it 's crucial to make necessary adjustments to the code within ( ns- simple.tcl ) . These modifications ensure that the network topology aligns with our experimental requirements , laying the groundwork for an accurate and meaningful simulation . For further clarification , refer to the accompanying images illustrating the network configuration and simulation setup . And here are the modified code to match the required network , see the following picture : And now for the code 's compilation result . As you can see in the following image , node 0 will begin transmitting data after 1.2 seconds based on TCP configuration , and data will also be lost after a certain amount of time because node 3 has reached its maximum . Node 0 and node 1 begin sending data to node 2 at the start of the simulation . Then we were asked to get the dropped and received packets in the simulated network , see the following results : Part2 : Three node ad hoc with DSDV We begin by generating the simple-dsdv.tcl file , which will include the adhoc network configuration , as we were instructed to establish three Wi-Fi nodes using the adhoc configuration mode in addition to the DSDV protocol . The written code is then compiled using the terminal , producing a file with the .tr extension . Following that , we discover both sent and received packets ; the ensuing image illustrates this . So we can the packet delivery fraction by dividing the received on the sent packets , so 5204 / 5225 which equal to 0.995 . Then after that we found the total number of routing packet sent , see the following picture : So we can figure out the routing load fraction which equal the routing packets dividing on the received packets , so it will equal to 41/5204 which equal to 0.0078 . Conclusion : In conclusion , this experiment has provided valuable insights into the distinction between ad hoc and infrastructure configuration modes , along with an understanding of various routing protocols and their practical application within specific network environments . Furthermore , we have acquired essential skills in network simulation using NS2 and NAM , supplemented by visualization through Xgraph . Overall , this hands-on experience has enriched our comprehension of wireless networking concepts and simulation techniques , laying a solid foundation for further exploration and study in this field .
